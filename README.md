This is an Oddle Front End Challenge

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Behind The Scenes

1. Built with NextJs (webpack included by default) and Material-UI (CSS in JS included)
2. Using Redux for State Management
3. Since it's NextJs, by default it is a SSR app
4. Some custom components are dinamically imported. This is one way of some to code splitting.
